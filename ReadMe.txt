				--------------------   VerySimpleCPU design	-----------------------------------


This code calculates 6! and writes the result which is 720 to 101st address in memory. 
To do that, first generate the corresponding memory initialization file for this program and then create a project in Xilinx ISEand add testbench.v and design.v (including yourVerySimpleCPUdesign andmemory)files intothis project. 
Switch to Simulation view and then run the simulation. 
You can either eyeball the waveform or check the simulation console to see whether VerySimpleCPU design works as expected (make sure that you edited testbench.v as required).

				-------------------- 	Assembly Part	---------------------------------------
Assembly program is finds the maximum of ten numbers which are consecutively stored in memory starting at address 500. 
The program will start at zero and write the maximum number to address 600.

After writing the assembly program, generate the correspondingmemory initialization file forthis program and then create a project in Xilinx ISE and add testbench.v and design.v (including your VerySimpleCPU design and memory) files into this project. Switch to Simulation view ( ) and then run the simulation. 
You can either eyeball the wave form or check thesimulation console to see whether your VerySimpleCPU design works as expected (make sure that you edited testbench.v as required).
